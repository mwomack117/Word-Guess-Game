# Word-Guess-Game

This project's aim was to make a Hangman web application game. 

The basic rules are to guess the letters of a randomly chossen word. 

The theme of the game is "wild west" with the random words relating to that genre. 


IT IS CURRENTLY STILL A WORK IN PROGRESS
I still need to figure out how to write pieces of code:
- that will keep track of the score and update it
- that will alert when the player has wn (with image/sound)
  and alert when remaining guesses are out and player has lossed (with image/sound)
